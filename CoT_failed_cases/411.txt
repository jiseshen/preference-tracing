Actions taken by Jennifer: Jennifer is situated in the bathroom. She proceeds to the kitchen and advances towards the dishwasher. 
Question: Which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Jennifer has been trying to get a wine glass. (b) Jennifer has been trying to get a water glass. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: a
Model Answer: b
Model Reasoning: Jennifer proceeded to the kitchen, which suggests she believes what she wants is in the kitchen. Upon arriving, she advanced towards the dishwasher. The dishwasher contains dish bowls, water glasses, and wine glasses. Since Jennifer specifically advanced towards the dishwasher, it indicates she believes what she wants might be in or near it. Given the options, the dishwasher contains both water glasses and wine glasses. However, Jennifer's action of advancing towards the dishwasher aligns more with seeking a water glass because she also perceived a water glass on the kitchen table and did not go towards it, suggesting she might be looking for a specific water glass type or quantity. Therefore, it is more likely that Jennifer has been trying to get a water glass.
