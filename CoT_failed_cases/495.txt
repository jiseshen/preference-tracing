The microwave is filled with two cupcakes, a condiment bottle, and a salmon. The dishwasher contains a water glass and a wine glass, while the stove houses a salmon. The sofa holds a dish bowl and a book. Lastly, the fridge contains an apple. 
Actions taken by Thomas: Thomas is situated in the bathroom. He proceeds towards the kitchen and advances towards the fifth kitchen cabinet. 
Question: Which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Thomas has been trying to get a water glass. (b) Thomas has been trying to get a dishbowl. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: a
Model Answer: b
Model Reasoning: Thomas first went to the bathroom and decided not to check the cabinet there, indicating he did not believe what he wanted was in the bathroom. He then proceeded to the kitchen, where he specifically advanced towards the fifth kitchen cabinet. This suggests he believed what he wanted might be in that cabinet. The fifth kitchen cabinet is empty, but Thomas did not know this before checking. The query asks whether Thomas has been trying to get a water glass or a dish bowl. The water glass is in the dishwasher, and the dish bowl is in the seventh kitchen cabinet and on the sofa. Thomas did not check the dishwasher or the seventh cabinet, which suggests he did not believe what he wanted was in those locations. However, he did check a kitchen cabinet, which is a more likely place for a dish bowl than a water glass, given the typical storage of these items. Therefore, it is more likely that Thomas was trying to get a dish bowl.
