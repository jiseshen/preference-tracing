Input: What's inside the apartment: The apartment consists of a bedroom, kitchen, living room, and bathroom. 
In the bedroom, there are two desks and a cabinet, which contains two plates, two books, a wine glass, a bottle of wine, and a water glass. 
The kitchen is equipped with two tables, eight cabinets, a stove, a dishwasher, a microwave, and a fridge. The first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth cabinets, from left to right, are empty. The second cabinet contains three dish bowls and a plate, while the seventh cabinet holds a plate. Inside the stove, there is a cupcake, and the dishwasher contains a plate. The microwave houses a condiment bottle and a salmon. On one of the kitchen tables, there is a cupcake. The fridge is stocked with a salmon, an apple, a bottle of wine, and a cupcake. 
The living room features a coffee table and a sofa. On the coffee table, there is a book, a remote control, and a dish bowl. A book and a water glass can be found on the sofa. 
Lastly, the bathroom has a cabinet, which is currently empty. 
Actions taken by Thomas: Thomas is situated in the living room. He proceeds to the kitchen, strides towards the fifth kitchen cabinet, opens it, and subsequently shuts it. He then moves towards the microwave, opens and closes it. Following this, he opens and closes the first and third kitchen cabinets in succession. Finally, he strides towards the fridge, opens it, and then closes it. 
Question: If Thomas has been trying to get a plate, which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Thomas thinks that the plate is not inside the dishwasher. (b) Thomas thinks that the plate is inside the dishwasher. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: a
Model Answer: b
Model Reasoning: Thomas has checked multiple locations in the kitchen, including the microwave, fridge, and several cabinets, but has not found what he wants. Since he has not checked the dishwasher, it is reasonable to infer that he might still consider it a potential location for the plate. Therefore, if Thomas has been trying to get a plate, it is more likely that he thinks the plate might be inside the dishwasher, as he has not yet dismissed it by checking.
