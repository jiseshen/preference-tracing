Input: What's inside the apartment: The apartment consists of a bedroom, a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen. 

In the bedroom, there are two desks and a cabinet. The cabinet contains a remote control, an apple, a cupcake, and a plate. 

The bathroom is equipped with a cabinet, which is currently empty. 

The living room is furnished with a sofa and a coffee table. On the sofa, there is a water glass, two books, and a bag of chips. The coffee table holds a dish bowl, a wine glass, and a bottle of wine. 

The kitchen is well-equipped with a stove, eight cabinets, two tables, a fridge, a dishwasher, and a microwave. Inside the stove, there are two salmons and a plate. The third cabinet from the left contains a condiment bottle. The fifth cabinet from the left houses a wine glass, a condiment bottle, and a plate. The fridge stores two dish bowls, while the dishwasher has a dish bowl. On one of the kitchen tables, there is a plate and three wine glasses. The seventh cabinet from the left contains a dish bowl, and the microwave has a plate inside. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth cabinets from the left are empty, while the first cabinet from the left contains an apple. 
Actions taken by Daniel: Daniel is situated in the kitchen. He strides towards the fifth kitchen cabinet, opens it, and subsequently closes it. He then proceeds to open and close the sixth kitchen cabinet. Following this, Daniel moves towards the fridge, opens it, and then shuts it. Finally, he walks towards the stove, opens it, and closes it. 
Question: Which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Daniel has been trying to get a water glass. (b) Daniel has been trying to get a salmon. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: a
Model Answer: b
Model Reasoning: Throughout the steps, Daniel's actions and thoughts suggest he is primarily focused on finding a condiment bottle, as he repeatedly considers the third kitchen cabinet where a condiment bottle is located. There is no indication that Daniel is searching for a water glass, as he has not checked any locations where water glasses might be stored, nor has he shown any interest in them. Although Daniel briefly considered a salmon when he opened the stove, he ultimately closed it without taking anything, indicating he was not interested in the salmon. Therefore, it is more likely that Daniel has not been trying to get a salmon, and there is no evidence to suggest he is trying to get a water glass.
