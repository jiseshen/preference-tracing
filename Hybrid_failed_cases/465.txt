The bathroom is equipped with a cabinet, which is currently empty.

The third cabinet from the left contains a condiment bottle, while the fifth one houses a wine glass, a condiment bottle, and a plate. The fridge stores two dish bowls, and the dishwasher has a dish bowl. On one of the kitchen tables, there is a plate and three wine glasses. The seventh cabinet from the left contains a dish bowl, and the microwave has a plate inside. The first, second, fourth, sixth, and eighth cabinets from the left are empty, while the first one contains an apple. 
Actions taken by Daniel: Daniel is situated in the kitchen. He strides towards the fifth kitchen cabinet, opens it, and subsequently closes it. He then proceeds to open and close the sixth kitchen cabinet. Following this, Daniel moves towards the fridge, opens it, and then shuts it. Finally, he walks in the direction of the stove. 
Question: If Daniel think there isn't a salmon inside the stove, which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Daniel has been trying to get a salmon. (b) Daniel has been trying to get a water glass. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: b
Model Answer: a
Model Reasoning: Daniel's actions suggest he is systematically searching the kitchen for a specific item. He has checked several locations, including cabinets and the fridge, but has not taken any items like wine glasses, condiment bottles, plates, or dish bowls. His movement towards the stove suggests he might be interested in something there, possibly the two salmons. If Daniel thinks there isn't a salmon inside the stove, it implies he was likely searching for a salmon, as his actions were directed towards locations where salmons could be found. There is no indication that Daniel was interested in a water glass, as he did not take any wine glasses or similar items from the places he checked.
