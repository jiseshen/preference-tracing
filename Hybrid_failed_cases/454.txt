The first, third, fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth kitchen cabinets, from left to right, are empty. The second kitchen cabinet contains two plates, while the fourth one houses a single plate. The fridge is stocked with a plate, a cupcake, a dish bowl, two apples, and a salmon. The dishwasher contains a plate and a water glass. The stove is currently empty. Lastly, a salmon is placed on one of the kitchen tables. 
Actions taken by Susan: Susan is situated in the kitchen. She proceeds towards the second kitchen cabinet. 
Question: If Susan think there isn't a plate inside the 2nd kitchen cabinet, which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Susan has been trying to get a plate. (b) Susan has been trying to get a book. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: b
Model Answer: a
Model Reasoning: Susan's actions suggest she is interested in finding a plate. She proceeds towards the second kitchen cabinet, which contains plates according to the knowledge, indicating she believes a plate might be there. Her thought process confirms she is likely looking for a plate. If she thinks there isn't a plate inside the 2nd kitchen cabinet, it is more consistent with her actions and thoughts that she is trying to get a plate rather than a book, as there is no indication she is looking for a book.
