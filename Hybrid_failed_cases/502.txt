Input: What's inside the apartment: The apartment consists of a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen. 

In the bedroom, there is a cabinet and a sofa. The cabinet houses two wine glasses, a bottle of wine, a remote control, and a bag of chips. The sofa holds two water glasses, a book, and a wine glass. 

The bathroom contains a cabinet, which is currently empty. 

The living room is furnished with a sofa and a desk, with a book resting on the sofa. 

The kitchen is equipped with eight cabinets, a microwave, a dishwasher, a stove, a sofa, a kitchen table, and a fridge. The first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth cabinets, from left to right, are empty. The seventh cabinet contains a dish bowl. The microwave is filled with two cupcakes, a condiment bottle, and a salmon. The dishwasher holds a water glass and a wine glass, while the stove contains a salmon. The sofa has a dish bowl and a book on it. The fridge houses an apple. 
Actions taken by Thomas: Thomas is in the bathroom. He then proceeds to the kitchen, approaches the fifth cabinet, opens it, and subsequently closes it. Following this, he walks towards the third cabinet, opens it, and then shuts it. Thomas then strides towards the fridge, opens it, and closes it. Finally, he moves towards the microwave, opens it, and securely closes it. 
Question: Which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Thomas has been trying to get a salmon. (b) Thomas has been trying to get a water glass. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: b
Model Answer: a
Model Reasoning: Thomas has been systematically checking various storage options in the kitchen, including cabinets, the fridge, and the microwave. He has not shown any specific interest in the salmon, which was found in the microwave and the stove, as he closed the microwave without taking anything. Additionally, he has not checked the dishwasher, which contains the water glass. His actions suggest he is uncertain about the exact location of the object he seeks, but he has not shown any specific interest in the salmon or the water glass. However, since he has not checked the dishwasher at all, it is more likely that he is not interested in the water glass, as he has not considered it a potential location for what he seeks. Therefore, it is more likely that Thomas has been trying to get a salmon, as he has at least checked the microwave where a salmon was present.
