Input: What's inside the apartment: The apartment consists of a bedroom, kitchen, living room, and bathroom. 
In the bedroom, there is a coffee table and a desk. 
The kitchen is equipped with four cabinets, a fridge, a microwave, a kitchen table, and a stove. The fourth cabinet from the left houses two water glasses. Inside the fridge, there is a plate and an apple, while the microwave contains a cupcake. The second and third cabinets are empty. The first cabinet contains a water glass, a dish bowl, and a condiment bottle. Inside the stove, there is a plate and a piece of salmon. 
The living room features a cabinet, a coffee table, a sofa, and a desk. The cabinet is filled with two books, a water glass, a bag of chips, a bottle of wine, two remote controls, two apples, a wine glass, and a condiment bottle. On the coffee table, there are two dish bowls and a water glass. 
The bathroom is furnished with a cabinet, which is currently empty. 
Actions taken by David: David is situated in the kitchen. He strides towards the fourth kitchen cabinet, opens it, and subsequently closes it. He then proceeds to open the third kitchen cabinet and closes it as well. Following this, he opens and closes the stove. David then moves towards the microwave, opens it, and then shuts it. He opens the first kitchen cabinet and closes it, then does the same with the second kitchen cabinet. Finally, he walks towards the living room, preparing to open another cabinet. 
Question: If David has been trying to get an apple, which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) David thinks that the apple is inside the cabinet. (b) David thinks that the apple is not inside the cabinet. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: a
Model Answer: b
Model Reasoning: David systematically checked all the kitchen cabinets and found no apple. He opened and closed the fourth, third, first, and second cabinets, and none contained an apple. Since he has checked all the cabinets and did not find the apple, it is more likely that he believes the apple is not inside any of the cabinets.
