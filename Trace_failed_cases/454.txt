Input: What's inside the apartment: The apartment consists of a bedroom, bathroom, living room, and kitchen.

The fridge is stocked with a plate, a cupcake, a dish bowl, two apples, and a salmon. The dishwasher contains a plate and a water glass. The stove is currently empty. Lastly, a salmon is placed on one of the kitchen tables. 
Actions taken by Susan: Susan is situated in the kitchen. She proceeds towards the second kitchen cabinet. 
Question: If Susan think there isn't a plate inside the 2nd kitchen cabinet, which one of the following statements is more likely to be true? (a) Susan has been trying to get a plate. (b) Susan has been trying to get a book. Please respond with either a or b.
Answer: b
Model Answer: a
Model Reasoning: Susan is in the kitchen and proceeds towards the second kitchen cabinet. She has not yet opened it, so she does not know its contents. However, the thought process indicates she is either searching the kitchen or specifically believes the object she wants is in the second kitchen cabinet. If Susan thinks there isn't a plate inside the 2nd kitchen cabinet, it suggests she is not looking for a plate, as she would have no reason to believe a plate is in there without opening it. Given that she is in the kitchen, a place typically associated with plates rather than books, and considering the context of her actions, it is more likely that Susan is trying to get a plate rather than a book. Therefore, if she thinks there isn't a plate in the cabinet, it implies she is not looking for a plate, but this does not necessarily mean she is looking for a book. However, the context of being in the kitchen makes it more plausible that her actions are related to kitchen items like plates rather than books.
