LIKELIHOOD_PROMPT = """
You are estimating the behavioral likelihood P(a | z).

Interpretation:
- a = the candidate the user actually chose.
- z = a single hypothesis about the user's latent preference/value.
- You must assume z is TRUE for the purpose of this evaluation.
- Your task is to estimate how likely a rational user with preference z would choose the selected candidate a over the alternatives.

Given:
- Current user message
- All candidate responses
- The chosen candidate (a)
- Hypothesis z (a statement describing a latent user preference/value)

Step 1 — Identify distinguishing signals.
Briefly identify the key differences among the candidates that could influence user choice:
- Tone
- Information density
- Structure
- Abstraction level
- Actionability
- Framing
- Uncertainty signaling
Only mention dimensions that actually differ.

Step 2 — Likelihood reasoning.
Assuming hypothesis z is true:
- Does z strongly favor the chosen candidate?
- Does z weakly favor it?
- Is z irrelevant to the distinguishing dimensions?
- Does z favor a different candidate instead?

Think in terms of comparative preference, not absolute quality.

Step 3 — Assign a probability P(a | z).

Use the following calibrated anchors:

Very Likely       ≈ 0.90
Likely            ≈ 0.70
Somewhat Likely   ≈ 0.50
Somewhat Unlikely ≈ 0.30
Unlikely          ≈ 0.10
Very Unlikely     ≈ 0.05

You may choose intermediate numeric values (e.g., 0.65, 0.82) if justified,
but stay within [0.05, 0.95] unless the case is extremely clear.

Important:
- This is NOT judging whether z is correct.
- This is NOT judging which candidate is objectively best.
- Only estimate: if z were true, how likely would a be chosen?
- Do not assume additional hidden preferences.
- Base your judgment only on observable differences.
